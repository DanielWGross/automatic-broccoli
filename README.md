1. Make sure our local main branch is up-to-date with our remote main branch
  - `git pull origin main` on the `main` branch
2. Create a new branch off the main branch (locally)
  - `git checkout -b feature/{feature-name}`
    - feature/add-navigation
    - feature/add-form
    - feature/style-homepage
    - style-homepage 
3. Write our code
  - Commit early
  - Commit often
  - Push to remote often
  - Make sure our work is small -- Ideally the work on this branch should last hours, not days.
4. Push our final working code to remote (github)
5. Open a Pull Request
6. Respond to comments and feedback
7. Merge our feature branch -> main branch
8. Delete our feature branch (optional)
